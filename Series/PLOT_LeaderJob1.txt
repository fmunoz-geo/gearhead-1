	% 01 - 05 :  Player has won the battle and is being paid.
	Msg1 <You did it. Good job.>
	Msg1_2 <With their leader shamed, the rest of the bandits have split up just as predicted. Here's your pay.>
	Msg1_3 <Their leader will never show his face around these parts again. Here's the pay you earned. Good job.>
	Msg1_4 <They thought their leader was invincible... well, you showed them they were wrong. Here's a reward for helping to protect \SCENE EScene 1 .>
	Msg1_5 <He thought he was undefeatable... I'm glad that you proved him wrong. Here's your pay for ridding \SCENE EScene 1 of the bandits.>

	% 06 - 10 :  Player has lost the battle.
	Msg6 <You lost... maybe their leader really is invincible?>
	Msg7 <He beat you... maybe their leader really is as good as they said?>
	Msg8 <You should have concentrated on the leader. They overwhelmed you.>
	Msg9 <You were overwhelmed and defeated. This is a sorry day.>
	Msg10 <We tried to shame the bandit lord, but it was us who were shamed...>

	% 11 - 15 :  PC got email about mission; asked to accept
	Msg11 <Ah, you've arrived. We have troubles here in \SCENE EScene 1 ; a local crime gang has started attacking trucks on the highway. I need someone to take the wind out of their sails.>
	Msg12 <So, did you get my email? There's a new bandit operating in \SCENE EScene 1 and I want to stop him before he gets too powerful.>
	Msg13 <I've been waiting for you. I sent an email concerning our troubles... there's a new bandit lord in \SCENE EScene 1 , and I need to stop him before he gets too powerful.>
	Msg14 <I guess you've heard by now. There's a new bandit lord in town, and I need some help to get rid of him.>
	Msg15 <Are you going to help us? I sent you an email about our problem... There's a new bandit operating in town. He's attracted all kinds of lowlifes to join his gang. I want to stop them before they become a real threat.>

	% 16 - 20 :  Player has "the right stuff"; will be offered mission.
	Msg16 <I need a cavalier to help me. There's a new bandit lord in town, and he needs to be stopped before he gets more powerful.>
	Msg17 <I have a mission available for a mecha pilot, if you're looking for work. There's a new bandit gang near town, and I want them driven out of the area.>
	Msg18 <I'm looking for a freelance pilot to run a civic defense mission. A crime gang has moved into town and they need to be driven back out again.>
	Msg19 <\SCENE EScene 1 needs your help. A powerful new bandit has founded a gang in this town. I want them driven out as soon as possible.>
	Msg20 <I have a job available for a cavalier. There's a new bandit gang in town, and I'd rather that they not stay here...>

	% 21 - 25 :  PC has accepted; describe the mission.
	Msg21 <If the leader were to be shamed, the rest of the gang would stop following him. You can do that if you defeat him in battle... The job pays $ \VAL V4 .>
	Msg22 <I'd like to resolve this issue with as little blooshed as possible. I just want their leader taken down. If the gang loses nerve, they'll split up and leave the area. I'll pay you $ \VAL V4 to make that happen.>
	Msg23 <There's too many bandits to fight them all, but take down the leader and the rest of the gang won't stick around long. It's worth $ \VAL V4 if you can defeat him in combat.>
	Msg24 <Their leader has piloting skills... which is why they all follow him. If you could beat him in combat, he'd lose the respect of the gang. I can give you $ \VAL V4 to make that happen.>
	Msg25 <All we need is to demoralize them and they'll move on. If the leader was defeated in combat, the other bandits would lose their respect for him, and the gang would break up. It's worth $ \VAL V4 if you can do that.>

	% 26 - 30 :  Combat is starting
	Msg26 <Good luck out there. I'll identify which mecha belongs to the leader. Shoot him down; you can ignore the others if you want. Or defeat them all and you can keep the salvage too.>
	Msg27 <I better warn you, there's a whole lot of them out there. Just aim straight for the leader... humiliating him in battle is the most important thing. Though if you can defeat them all the salvage is yours.>
	Msg28 <The leader's mecha will be identified when you reach the field; don't let him defeat you. Beat the lot of them and I'll throw in the salvage.>
	Msg29 <Good luck. Strike quickly, then make a clean getaway. Or if you think you can take them defeat the whole gang and you can keep the salvage.>
	Msg30 <Do battle for \SCENE ESCene 1 ! Defeat them all and you can keep the salvage.>

	% 31 - 35 :  Describe enemy point value
	Msg31 <The gang has around \VAL V3 points worth of mecha. Your best bet is to ignore most of them, and just concentrate on taking down the boss!>
	Msg32 <They've got about \VAL V3 tactical points worth of equipment. You probably can't handle all of that in a fair fight...>
	Msg33 <Their leader is always protected by \VAL V3 tactical points of his best men. He's going to be a hard target.>
	Msg34 <You're looking at around \VAL V3 threat points. That's a lot to deal with... Think you can do it?>
	Msg35 <So far the gang has scrounged \VAL V3 points worth of mecha, and they're going to get a lot more if we can't stop them soon!>


	% 101 :  Player is back from repairs, time to start mission.
	Msg101 <Are you ready to start the mission yet?>
