	Msg1 <With the evidence you collected, I should be able to bring charges against the mecha gang. Good work.>
	Msg2 <\ELEMENT 1 in \SCENE EScene 1 asked you to investigate a mecha gang.>
	Msg3 <A suspicious mecha gang has moved into this jurisdiction. I've been keeping an eye on them.>
	Msg4 <A guardian's work is never done. I could use a mecha pilot to assist in this case, but they seem to be in short supply these days.>
	Msg5 <Are you sure? I'd really appreciate the help, but I have to tell you that there's no reward being offered for this operation.>
	Msg6 <Much as I appreciate the sentiment, I'm afraid that I can't condone any unlawful actions. Still, if you'd like to investigate their base, I'd appreciate the help. And if they attack you then you're free to take them out. No reward, though.>
	Msg7 <Thanks for the offer, but I think I'll stick to conventional methodology.>
	Msg8 <Thank you. Take care out there.>
	Msg9 <I understand completely.>
	Msg10 <Hey, I have a personal favor to ask of you. I need a pilot to run a mission, but there's no bounty allocated for this one. Could you do this job for me?>

	Msg11 <The bandit gang "Igor's Marauders" has established a new headquarters in our jurisdiction. I want you to investigate this area, and engage the bandits if they act agressive. Be careful... these criminals are known to be quite deadly.>
	Msg12 <A mecha death-cult, "Slaves to the Dark God", has set up a base and recruitment center near here. I want you to scout out their encampment and gather evidence. If they fire on you, feel free to exterminate them. Be careful.>
	Msg13 <The dreaded gang "Bjorn's Berserkers" have set up a base in this area. I want you to investigate them, and eliminate them if it appears that they are planning criminal activity.>
	Msg14 <It's been rumored that "Vadim's Roughnecks", an infamous team of mecha thieves, has set up a small base in this area. I want you to explore these coordinates. If the thieves are discovered, it may be nessecary to fight them.>
	Msg15 <There's a new bandit gang in town. They call themselves "Saepheroth Circle". I want you to check out their hideout, and make contact with their leader if possible. If they attack your mecha you are cleared to use deadly force against them.>
	Msg16 <I've discovered that the mecha gang "El Toki Diablo" has a base near here. I need you to investigate them and find out what their intentions are. If it seems that they are up to no good, you are cleared to use force against them.>
	Msg17 <Reports indicate that a mecha gang called "The Dingo Weasels" has moved into town. I need you to investigate their encampment and report their intentions.>
	Msg18 <A group of bandit wannabes calling themselves "The Doomed Patrol" have set up camp outside of town. I need you to investigate their whereabouts. You can engage them in combat if they are agressive towards you.>
	Msg19 <A mecha gang called "Redshirt Legion" has set up a base near here. I'd like for you to scout them out, and report back. If they react violently to your presence, you're cleared to eliminate them.>
	Msg20 <A gang calling themselves "The Expendables" has moved into town. I'd appreciate it if you would investigate their base, and report back to me. If they act agressive, you are cleared to use deadly force.>

	Msg21 <Here are the coordinates. Thank you very much for doing this!>
	Msg22 <I have a lot of work to do today. Unfortunately none of it is interesting.>

	Msg101 <There's a new mecha gang operating in the area and I need someone to go check them out. There's no reward for this mission, but I'd appreciate it if you could help me.>
	Msg102 <I could use some help from a mecha pilot, if you're up for a bit of community service.>
	Msg103 <I need a mecha pilot to investigate a criminal gang that just moved into town. I can't offer a reward, but if you do this our city will be thankful.>
	Msg104 <How'd you like to help me out? I need a pilot to go investigate the activities of a mecha gang. There's no cash involved in this job... Think of it as community service.>
	Msg105 <Upholding the peace is everyone's responsibility. I need a volunteer mecha pilot to go disperse some hoodlums. The only reward to be had is the knowledge that you're protecting our city.>

	Msg111 <Some new mecha-punks have just rolled into town. I think they're the same ones involved in those robberies last year, but I'm going to need more information before I can move.>
	Msg112 <I'm busy investigating a new criminal gang that seems to be moving into our jurisdiction. The only charge I have against them yet is that their meks don't have proper registration, but I think they're up to something.>
	Msg113 <One of our crime gangs has just acquired some fancy new hardware. I don't know what they're planning to use it for, but I can't move against them until I do.>
	Msg114 <A new crime gang just moved into the region. They've set up a hideaway in the wilds outside of town. I'd like to drive them away, but I don't have the manpower to waste right now.>
	Msg115 <I've been tracking the movements of a mecha gang that just started operating in the last month or so. I believe they're connected to a number of attacks against civilian vehicles, but I'll need more info before I can pin anything on them.>

	Msg121 <Excellent work. You've been a great help, I only wish I had a reward to give you.>
	Msg122 <Those bandits won't be bothering anyone ever again. Good job.>
	Msg123 <Thank you so much! You did great out there against those criminals... Hopefully next time I'll have a paying job for you.>
	Msg124 <Just as I thought, those lowlifes were up to no good. Thanks for your help.>
	Msg125 <The criminals have fled the area. You've done well protecting our city.>
	Msg126 <Congradulations on a job well done. Come back sometime and I'll see if I can find a paying job for you.>

	prompt1 <I can scout their base for you.>
	prompt2 <I can make them leave the area.>
	prompt3 <I wish you the best of luck.>

	prompt4 <I'd be glad to help.>
	prompt5 <Sorry, I don't work for free.>

	prompt6 <I'll report back when I'm done.>
