	name <GSP: Atomic War Club>
	% Quite possibly the simplest GSP story yet... Just a loader for the Atomic War Club
	% plot, so that it will only happen once per adventure.

	% N1 is the scene where the story will take place.
	% N2 is the character who will give the mission. Maybe.
	%  At least we know that there's a scientist in town...
