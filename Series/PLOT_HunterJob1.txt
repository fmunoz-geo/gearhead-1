	Msg1 <Well, what's the status on the contract? Have you tracked down that madman yet?>
	Msg2 <Back already? You look in better shape than I thought you would... So, have you brought that killer to justice?>
	Msg3 <I want to hear some good news right now. What's the status of the mission I sent you on?>
	Msg4 <Have you completed the mission yet?>
	Msg5 <How's the mission going?>

	Msg6 <Good to see you. I have a mission available if you're looking for work, but I don't know if it's the kind of thing you'd be interested in.>
	Msg7 <Bounty hunting is tough, dangerous, and often dehumanizing... But at least it gets you out in the fresh air.>
	Msg8 <There's too much to do, and I don't have enough time to spread around.>
	Msg9 <The only thing worse than when business is bad is when business is good.>
	Msg10 <If you're looking for a job, you'll probably want to work on your relationships.>

	Msg11 <Come back here when you're done and I'll see about providing that reward I offered.>
	Msg12 <You shouldn't waste my time if you haven't completed the job yet. Most hunters aren't as forgiving of annoyance as I am.>
	Msg13 <Come back when you have some results.>
	Msg14 <Don't bother coming back unless you've caught the bandit.>
	Msg15 <Huh.>

	Msg16 <\Element 3 is a psychotic murderer who is supposed to be hiding in the \ELEMENT 2 area. There's a bounty of \VAL V3 to bring this creep to justice. I wouldn't waste any time trying to reason with him...>
	Msg17 <You're after a psychopath who's been hiding out in \ELEMENT 2 or thereabouts. Supposedly \ELEMENT 3 took too many shots of combat-stim, and now just can't stop killing... The reward is \VAL V3 creds, payable dead or alive.>
	Msg18 <Your target is a psycho killer on the run from the guardians, the army, and who knows who else. His mind is completely destroyed... The reward is \VAL V3 dollars. \ELEMENT 2 is where you should be able to find him.>
	Msg19 <I need you to track down an escaped killer, a complete brainfrag by the name of \ELEMENT 3 who's been hiding out in \ELEMENT 2 for the past few months. Reward is \VAL V3 payable upon confirmation of the target's death.>
	Msg20 <\Element 3 has been hiding in \ELEMENT 2 after a killing spree which left 17 innocent civilians dead. Don't even think of trying to reason with this animal. The reward for stopping this crack is \VAL V3 payable upon confirmation of death.>

	Msg21 <Justice has been served. Congratulations on a job well done.>
	Msg22 <Eh, those are the breaks...>
	Msg23 <When you're done with the mission come see me and I'll fix you up with that reward.>
	Msg24 <\ELEMENT 1 in \SCENE EScene 1 asked you to go to \ELEMENT 2 to eliminate a wanted murderer>

	Prompt1 <I'm working on it.>
	Prompt2 <Everything's going according to plan.>
	Prompt3 <Could you remind me of the details?>
	Prompt4 <What am I supposed to do again?>
	Prompt5 <The mission has been completed.>

	Prompt6 <The killer has been eliminated.>
	Prompt7 <What kind of mission is it?>
	Prompt8 <I'll do anything if the pay is good.>
	Prompt9 <Sorry, I'm too busy with other matters.>
	Prompt10 <I'll do it.>

	Prompt11 <No, I don't want this mission...>
