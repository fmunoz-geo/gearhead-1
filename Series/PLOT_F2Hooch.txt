	Msg3 <Could you? I'd offer a reward for doing so, but I already gave the $50 to \OPR E3 . Eh, I'm sure \SPR E3 'll be alright, \SPR E3 's just being lazy as usual.>

	Msg5 <Off you go, then.>
	Msg6 <I'm sure \SPR E3 'll turn up. \SPR E3 probably just sampled a bit of the merchandise, and is sleeping it off on the cabin floor.>
