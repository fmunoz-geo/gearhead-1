	Msg1 <You shouldn't go poking around here. You aren't authorized for this lab. However, since you are the type to go poking around... I have a job you may be interested in.>
	Msg2 <You destroyed the spawning vat in the BioCorp lab basement.>
	Msg4 <It's not very reasonable to refuse my offer before you've even heard the details.>
	Msg5 <BioCorp industries has a delicate problem. Beneath this lab is an old production complex, currently infested with bioweapons. If their spawning vat were destroyed, they could no longer reproduce. I'll pay $23000 if you can destroy it.>
	Msg6 <Yes. You can find the entrance to the complex in our storage cell. Be careful of the monsters... they are the most dangerous creatures technology can produce.>
	Msg7 <\PERSONA 2407 in \SCENE SCeneID wants you to destroy the spawning vat in the basement of BioCorp Labs.>
	Msg8 <It is.>
	Msg9 <We were obliged to, it is true, but deactivating the Hunter-X series has proved to be more difficult than was expected. In this case we have opted for containment instead.>
	Msg10 <Please put an end to these unwanted creatures once and for all.>
	Msg11 <Thank you for destroying the spawning vat. Here's your reward. I think we may all sleep a little easier tonight.>
	Prompt1 <I'm not interested in working for you.>
	Prompt2 <Tell me about it.>
	Prompt3 <I'll do it for you.>
	Prompt4 <That sounds too dangerous.>
	Prompt5 <Wasn't BioCorp ordered to destroy them?>
