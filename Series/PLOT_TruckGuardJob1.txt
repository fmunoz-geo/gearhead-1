	Msg11 <A stretch of highway outside of town is notorious for bandit attacks. Your job is to accompany one of our trucks and defend it until it gets past that area. Pay for the job is $ \VAL V4 .>
	Msg12 <We're very concerned about raider attacks while leaving town. I need you to guard one of our trucks as it passes through a particularly dangerous spot. You'll earn $ \VAL V4 , so long as our truck makes it through in one piece.>
	Msg13 <You'll need to guard one of our trucks as it passes through "Ravager Alley". I can offer $ \VAL V4 for this mission.>
	Msg14 <Our convoy will be leaving town via a particularly dangerous stretch of highway that's been abandoned by the guardians. Your job is to keep our truck safe as it runs the gauntlet. For doing so, you'll earn $ \VAL V4 .>
	Msg15 <In order to avoid the highway patrol, we'll be leaving town via a seldom-used back road. Unfortunately that road is frequented by gangs... but as long as we get past them we should make excellent time to \SCENE E2 . Pay is $ \VAL V4 .>

	% 16 - 20 :  Player is asked if he is looking for a job.
	Msg16 <Hey, are you a wandering mecha pilot looking for work? If so, I have just what you'll be needing right here!>
	Msg17 <I could use a mecha pilot to guard a shipment. You up for that kind of thing?>
	Msg18 <There's a lot of bandits out there. Our trucks need someone to protect them. Are you looking for a mecha piloting job?>
	Msg19 <The roads aren't safe anymore. The company needs a mecha pilot to guard a shipment headed for \ELEMENT 2 . Think you'd like to get involved?>
	Msg20 <I need a pilot to guard a truck. You interested in that kind of work or not? If no, I better go find someone else...>

	% 21 - 25 :  NPC implies job, PC might have chance to get it.
	Msg21 <We've lost too much money to bandit raids lately. I've got another convoy moving out this afternoon, and I'm worried about it.>
	Msg22 <Some of the other truckers have been scared because too many shipments have been lost to the bandits. Guess that makes it a pretty good time to have a less-than-stellar sense of self preservation, eh?>
	Msg23 <The roads between \SCENE EScene 1 and \ELEMENT 2 are maggoty with bandits. It's hardly safe to be a trucker anymore.>
	Msg24 <I've got a shipment heading out later today, but I'm worried that the highway bandits are going to steal this one too.>
	Msg25 <I need to send a truck to \ELEMENT 2 , but with all the bandits on the highway I don't know if it'll make it.>

	% 26 - 30 :  Why are you taking such a dangerous route?
	Msg26 <Look, I don't question you about mecha piloting, don't you question me about trucking. This is the route we're taking. Either you sign up for the job or I'll find someone who will.>
	Msg27 <It's much quicker to travel the dangerous roads. There we only have to worry about bandits... if we followed the main roads, we'd have to deal with commuters, traffic police, photo radar...>
	Msg28 <That's a good question. I'll be sure to look into it. For right now, though, I have a truck ready to move out and no time to think about changing the route.>
	Msg29 <Beats me.>

	Msg34 <Want to work for me? I've got a mission coming up that I could use a pilot for.>
	Msg35 <You bumming around for a job or something? Well, you're lucky, because I have one for you. As long as you're a mecha pilot, that is... A good one, I mean.>

	% 36 - 40 :  Combat is starting.
	Msg36 <Remember, you just got to get the truck through safely. There's no need to go taking on all the bandits. Good luck, and come back here when you're done.>
	Msg37 <Protect the truck until it's through the pass. That's all you have to do. Come back when you're finished and I'll pay you then.>
	Msg38 <Make sure none of them bandits get near that truck! If you can do that, I can set you up with your pay when you gets back.>
	Msg39 <Protect the truck at all costs. Once it's through the pass, get yourself out of there as well.>
