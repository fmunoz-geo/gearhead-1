	Msg1 <I heard about what you said to Megi. She's still really angry at you... So, are you really a thief set to rob this town of everything it has?>
	Msg2 <You've got that right. Still, if you were interested in making a bit of illicit cash while you're in town, I might just have a few jobs for you...>
	Msg3 <Well, you aren't going to have a very long career as a thief if you're that obvious about it. I could give you some pointers, help you out a bit... what do you say?>
	Msg4 <I guess not. Still, you should know that Megi really thinks you were being serious. If you were interested I know how we could make some quick cash, if you really are up for a bit of petty thievery.>
	Msg5 <Hello again. My offer is still good... How'd you like to be my partner in crime?>
	Msg6 <Very good... There's a wide world of oppurtunity and vice out there for sharp young entrepreneurs like you and me. Meet me back here in a few minutes, I'll fill you in on the details then.>
	Msg7 <That's too bad. I could really use someone with your obvious talents on my side... If you ever change your mind, be sure to come back.>

		Msg1 <Before we can start on our wonderful crime spree, there's something I need you to do. See, I've got a bunch of unpaid parking tickets, and \ELEMENT 3 has imponded my car. I need for you to convince him to forget about my record.>
		Msg2 <Uh, I don't think that's a good idea. Aside from the fact that \ELEMENT 3 has a lot of friends around here, you should also know that guardians are pretty tough fighters. I'd suggest that you find a more peaceful solution.>
		Msg3 <Go talk to \PERSONA E3 and see if you can reach a mutual understanding. Intimidation is one of a career criminal's best tools, as is the ability to tell a convincing lie...>
		Msg4 <Because \PERSONA E3 doesn't like me and won't listen to a thing I say. Maybe you can have better luck...>
		Msg5 <Go talk to \ELEMENT 3 about my parking tickets. We can't do anything else until you get my car out of stock.>
		Msg6 <Good job. You'll make a great con artist someday. Now that my vehicles are out of the stockade, we can begin phase two of the plan.>
		Msg7 <Uhhh... that was a bit of unnessecary violence, wasn't it!? Anyhow, you got the tickets cancelled, for that I'm grateful... now we start phase two of the plan.>
		Msg8 <Robbing convoys is the mainstay of the bandit trade, and for that you'll need a mecha. Here are the keys to my Razer; it's a bit light, but that's perfect for sneaky hit and run attacks.>
		Msg9 <Head to the town of Ipshil. Connect up with the bandits there; maybe some of them will have jobs for you. Get some experience and reputation, then come back here.>

		prompt1 <Alright, I'll just rough him up a bit.>
		prompt2 <How do you suggest I do that?>
		prompt3 <Why don't you do that yourself?>

		Msg1 <What can I do for you today?>
		Msg2 <Really? Well, what do you have to say about all these unpaid parking tickets? I suppose you just expect me to forget about them...>
		Msg3 <Some business, huh? This wouldn't have anything to do with \ELEMENT 2 and all those parking tickets, would it? I hope you don't expect me to just drop all the charges.>
		Msg4 <Okay, let's chat.>
		Msg5 <Do you really think so? Well, I guess that I could have been mistaken... With a character reference like you I'll have to reassess things. You can tell \ELEMENT 2 that the tickets have been cancelled.>
		Msg6 <I don't believe that for one second. You're not exactly known as the most reliable character witness, you know.>
		Msg7 <Hey, they're just parking tickets, no reason to get upset. If you're gonna risk your life by threatening a guardian this must be pretty important to you. Tell \ELEMENT 2 that the tickets have been revoked.>
		Msg8 <And if you want to live, you won't go around talking that way to guardians.>
		Msg9 <For you, sure, I can do that. Tell \ELEMENT 2 that the parking tickets have been cancelled.>
		Msg10 <You seem like a nice enough person, but I'm sorry I can't do that for you.>
		Msg11 <Why would I do that!? I don't even like you! You annoy me!>
		Msg12 <A bribe, huh? I'll make you a deal... I will forget about the parking tickets, if you go away and stop bothering me. Okay?>
		Msg13 <Are you offering me a bribe? Look, if you had the kind of money it'd take to bribe me, you'd have more than enough to just simply pay the fines.>

		Prompt1 <\ELEMENT 2 sent me to talk.>
		Prompt2 <We have some business to discuss.>
		Prompt3 <I just want to chat.>
		Prompt4 <It's a mistake! \ELEMENT 2 is innocent!>
		Prompt5 <If you want to live, you will.>
		Prompt6 <Can you do it as a personal favor to me?>
		Prompt7 <I could make it worth your while.>
