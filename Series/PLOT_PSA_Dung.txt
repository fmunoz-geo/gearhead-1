	Msg1 <I suppose that a seasoned adventurer such as yourself has had plenty of experience in the dungeons.>
	Msg2 <Have you visited the dungeons yet? They're very dangerous.>
	Msg3 <There's no end to the monsters in a dungeon. Some scientists were trying to find out where all the monsters come from, but they all met untimely (and grisly) deaths...>
	Msg4 <Dungeons are very dangerous places. You'd be best advised to take precautions before entering one.>
	Msg5 <Oh, you have? Well, I guess you already know everything I was going to tell you...>
	Msg6 <Originally the word "dungeon" meant an underground chamber, but in modern times it's come to mean a dangerous location infested with monsters.>
	Msg7 <Primarily because of all the monsters that live there. Secondarily because in a dungeon, there's no safe place to rest.>
	Msg8 <Bring plenty of ammunition, good armor, weapons, and a GPS locator so your family can locate your remains if you get slaughtered by the monsters.>
	Msg9 <Sometimes there's lost treasure in a dungeon. Some criminals use them as hideouts. Also, many adventurers say that fighting monsters is the best way to gain fighting practice.>
	Msg10 <For every one Steve Irwin there's about a dozen Marlon Perkinses who have to lose their lives tragically, it seems.>
	Msg11 <Good luck, and safe journeys!>
	Msg12 <Not much. I was just going to tell you about how dangerous dungeons are, how they're full of monsters, and how they can steadily peck even an experienced warrior to death.>
	Msg13 <All kinds. Radioactive mutants, genetic experiments gone wrong, alien exo-fauna. You name it, and you can probably find it in a dungeon.>
	Msg14 <Nobody knows. Certainly, these creatures breed quickly. They often live in small crevices which are impassable to human beings. Also, they can smell fresh food from a long distance away... That'd be adventurers, quite often.>

	Prompt1 <Yes I have.>
	Prompt2 <No, not really.>
	Prompt3 <I've seen them.>
	Prompt4 <What's a dungeon?>
	Prompt5 <Why are they so dangerous?>
	Prompt6 <What kind of precautions?>
	Prompt7 <Why would I even want to enter one?>
	Prompt8 <I'm not suprised.>
	Prompt9 <Probably.>
	Prompt10 <What were you going to say?>
	Prompt11 <What kind of monsters?>
	Prompt12 <Where do all the monsters come from?>
