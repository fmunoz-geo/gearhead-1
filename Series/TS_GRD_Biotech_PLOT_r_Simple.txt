	% 01 - 05 :  Player has won the battle and is being paid.
	Msg1 <Here's your pay for the mission. If these creatures match the sample from \ELEMENT 3 , we may be on our way to building a case. I hear they've been hit pretty hard by the monsters over there.>
	Msg2 <You did it! You must be a great fighter. Here's the reward. If you're interested, they could probably use your help in \ELEMENT 3 . I hear they've been having monster problems as well.>
	Msg3 <That was great. Here's the bounty you earned. The lab boys say that the creatures you killed match those found in \ELEMENT 3 ; if you want to continue the investigation, that's where you should head next.>
	Msg4 <Here's your reward. I got a call from the guardian office in \ELEMENT 3 ; they could use your help with their monsters.>
	Msg5 <You've defended our city. If you're up for some more action, I hear that there's also been a monster attack in \ELEMENT 3 .>

	% 06 - 10 :  Player has lost the battle.
	Msg6 <Nasty little buggers, aren't they? Maybe next time I should send a team out against them. You can try again when you're ready.>
	Msg7 <Well, you survived, at least. We're going to have to increase security in town until all those creatures have been accounted for. If you want you can try again later.>
	Msg8 <You have failed to stop the creatures. If you want, you can have another try later.>
	Msg9 <The mission was a failure. You can try again, but next time try harder...>
	Msg10 <Without any fresh carcasses to examine, our forensics department won't be able to tell where these monsters have been coming from, or even what they are. Come back later and you can try again.>

	% 11 - 15 :  Description of mission.
	Msg11 <I can give you $ \VAL V4 to hunt down and destroy these things. That way, our forensics lab will get some fresh carcasses to examine. How about it?>
	Msg12 <The creatures seem to be coming from a wildzone just outside of town. There's a reward of $ \VAL V4 to eliminate them.>
	Msg13 <We need a good sample for the forensics lab to analyze. It's my guess that these aren't natural creatures. There's a reward of $ \VAL V4 available for monster remains.>
	Msg14 <Our best bet is that these monsters are some kind of biological weapon, probably escaped from a research facility. To find out for sure we'll need samples. There's a reward of $ \VAL V4 if you can get some.>
	Msg15 <These creatures are dangerous. They nearly killed me, and I'm a guardian... they have to be stopped. There's a reward of $ \VAL V4 for doing so, if you think you can.>

	% 16 - 20 :  Player is asked if he is looking for a job.
	Msg16 <I haven't been working for a while ever since I got nearly torn to shreds by those... things. If you're looking for a job, I need someone to go hunt down some monsters.>
	Msg17 <Are you up for some hunting work? I was attacked while investigating a mysterious creature... I need someone to go finish that job.>
	Msg18 <Have you heard about the "monsters"? Well, I was nearly killed by one, and they're real enough! I don't know much more than that, unfortunately. I could use some help to get rid of them.>
	Msg19 <Everybody's convinced that these mysterious creatures are "monsters". I've fought with them, and I think they may be man-made. I'll need the assistance of a hunter in order to prove that.>
	Msg20 <Looking for work? I've got a hunting contract available.>

	% 21 - 25 :  NPC implies job, PC might have chance to get it.
	Msg21 <You are advised to exercise caution when traveling beyond the city limits. There have been dangerous animals sighted near town... I assume you've heard of these "monsters"?>
	Msg22 <An official warning has been extended to the \SCENE EScene 2 area. There are dangerous animals on the loose; all citizens should exercise caution until they have been captured.>
	Msg23 <Take care. Word is that we've got "monsters" on the loose.>
	Msg24 <Exercise caution when entering or leaving town. There have been reports of a vicious creature attacking travellers near the city limits.>
	Msg25 <There's a dangerous monster in the area, so all travellers should be extra cautious.>

	Msg26 <The best guess that we have so far: We're dealing with some kind of bioconstruct, a man-made organism, possibly a weapon. We'll need some fresh cadavers to find out who made them, if they can reproduce naturally...>
	Msg27 <The best guess? That they're bioweapons, either escaped from an illegal facility or intentionally released. The greatest fear? That they can somehow reproduce by themselves, like the Cyclops. That's why we need samples.>
	Msg28 <I don't know... no-one does, certainly. I had a good look at them and I think they were Hunter-X bioweapons. I have no idea who built them or how, that's why we need some samples.>
	Msg29 <They're dangerous. More evidence will be needed before I can say anything more specific.>
	Msg30 <These could be bioweapons... that would be a horror. Who's producing them, and why?>

	% 31 - 35 :  "PLAN A" or "PLAN B" worked... the PC is offered
	%  a job and may choose either prompt7/8 to accept or prompt9/10
	%  to reject it.
	Msg31 <I've seen them myself, and I can tell you that they're very dangerous. You sure you want a chance to face them?>
	Msg32 <If you'd like to see these creatures yourself, I think I can arrange a meeting. They nearly ripped me to shreds... I need someone to run patrols while I recover.>
	Msg33 <You could be of use to us. If you're interested in a hunting job, I need someone to locate and destroy these creatures.>
	Msg34 <I have a patrol mission available, if you're up for it. These creatures must be destroyed before they hurt anyone else. Do you want to take part?>
	Msg35 <If you'd like to work for the guardians, I could use someone to go eliminate these creatures.>

	% 36 - 40 :  Combat is starting.
	Msg36 <Good luck.>
	Msg37 <Break a leg... preferably one of theirs.>
	Msg38 <Come back here for your reward if you survive.>
	Msg39 <Come back alive.>
	Msg40 <Meet me back here once you've finished the patrol.>

	% 41 - 45 :  PC has done previous mission in set
	Msg41 <I heard that you've fought against the same monsters I did. If you want to do it again, I have a mission available.>
	Msg42 <Those monsters you fought before? They nearly killed me... they seem to become stronger and more numerous the closer we get to their source. How'd you like to take them on again?>
	Msg43 <You have quite a reputation as a monster-slayer. We've been seeing strange creatures in this town as well... Have you come to help us?>
	Msg44 <Huh, it seems that you dealt with your monsters far better than I did with mine. I've been off on disability since fighting them last. If you're willing to face them again, I have a patrol job open.>
	Msg45 <I heard that you've been assisting in the "monster" investigation. If you'd like to continue that work, I have a mission for you.>

	% 103 :  Player has asked for some time to get ready.
	Msg103 <Reload, grab something to eat, and do whatever else you have to do.>
	% 104 :  "PLAN A" has failed, and the PC is not offered a job.
	Msg104 <Everything that can be done is being done. Don't worry about it.>
	% 105 :  "PLAN B" has failed, and the PC is not offered a job.
	Msg105 <I went face to face with those creatures. Maybe someday you'll see them and change your tune.>

	Prompt17 <Whatever.>
	Prompt18 <Let's talk about something else.>
	Prompt19 <I'm not concerned about that.>
