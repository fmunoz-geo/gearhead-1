	Msg1 <I absolutely love shopping. I just wish I had some more money to do it with...>
	Msg2 <I know this great little clothing store on the other side of town. The storekeeper knows me so I always get a good price on things.>
	Msg3 <My mother used to drag me around to all the markets when I was a little kid... I guess that's why I love haggling now.>
	Msg4 <I don't like that store. I think the keeper raises the prices every time I walk in... I don't like him much, either.>
	Msg5 <It takes a lot of practice to be a good shopper. I'm content to keep on practicing!>
	Msg6 <Sure, my clothes aren't the expensive brands, but I can still look really good. I think most people would be better off if they didn't chase after every expensive thing, and just had what they really need.>
	Msg101 <I've been reading about the new styles on internet and everything's so overpriced. I think I manage to look good, even though I don't spend a lot on my wardrobe.>
	Msg102 <Hey, are you looking for some new clothes? I know this little place which has really good merchandise and isn't too expensive.>
	Msg103 <Would you describe yourself as a sensible shopper? This entire outfit cost less than $20... I feel like such a shopping master.>
	Msg104 <Whatever. It's no bother to me if you want to keep throwing your money away...>
	Msg105 <Screw you, there's plenty of people who think I look great...>
	Msg106 <Do you think so? What do you think I should wear instead?>
	Msg107 <Would you believe that this entire ourfit cost less than $30? I may be a shopaholic, but at least I know where to shop.>
	Msg108 <Okay. You help fund my next shopping expedition, and I'll help you with the basic rules of haggling!>
	Msg109 <Happy shopping!>
	Msg110 <Er... Nothing, I guess, if that's the look you're trying to present.>
	Msg111 <Ha ha, listen carefully my pupil. This is everything you need to know about shopping.>
	Msg112 <I can always change my clothes, but you'll be stuck with that ugly face for a lifetime.>
	Msg113 <Forget about it. You're entitled to your opinions like anyone else...>
	Msg114 <Forget it. You're entitled to your own opinion.>
	Msg115 <I'm not exactly into "casual", but I think I know what you're getting at. Yeah, that might be a good idea. So, do you want to hear about bargain hunting?>
	Msg116 <Really? I guess that's your kind of look but I never thought about it for myself... I do know this one shop where they have some great biker goods for dirt cheap.>
	Msg117 <You think so? I was thinking about that but never had the nerve to go with it... I do know this one shop that has some nice items, and it's not too expensive. Want to hear about it?>
	Msg118 <That's the dumbest idea I've ever heard.>
	Msg119 <The trouble is that the latest clothes are all overpriced. I like to buy things when they're a month of two older and the price has come down. Of course, I do know about one place...>
	Msg120 <I can share with you everything I know about shopping, if you'll help to fund my next shopping trip!>
	Msg121 <You may be happy with it, but have some consideration for those around you!>
	Msg122 <You won't regret this! Help me pay for my next shopping expedition, and I'll explain to you everything you need to know about living cheap!>
	Msg123 <Shopping boring? What kind of a creature are you? You can't be human, that's for sure... just kidding.>

	Prompt1 <Yes you do.>
	Prompt2 <You could look better.>
	Prompt3 <Tell me about it!>
	Prompt4 <Why? What's wrong with my clothes?>
	Prompt5 <Tell me your secrets!>
	Prompt6 <I'm not interested.>
	Prompt7 <Too bad they're all blind.>
	Prompt8 <I'm sorry I said that.>
	Prompt9 <Just trying to help...>
	Prompt10 <Something more casual.>
	Prompt11 <Black leather, and plenty of it.>
	Prompt12 <You need to be more modern.>
	Prompt13 <Please, share your secrets!>
	Prompt14 <I'm happy with the way I look.>
	Prompt15 <Okay, tell me about shopping...>
	Prompt16 <No, that sounds boring.>
