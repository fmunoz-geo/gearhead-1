	Msg1 <Please go help my mother! I'm certain that something has gone wrong...>
	Msg2 <I'm very concerned about my mother... She's a scientist with BioCorp. Well, they're working on something at their mesa lab, but she didn't come home last night... I haven't even received a phone call. I'm certain that something is wrong.>
	Msg3 <I hope everything is going well at the lab...>
	Msg4 <I don't know. She was never allowed to talk about her work... not that she would have done that even if she could. Tell me, you're a cavalier... Could you go up there and see what's going on?>
	Msg5 <Don't say that! I worry it might be true... The mesa project is top secret, they haven't even announced to the shareholders what it's about. Could you go up there, just to make sure my mother is okay?>
	Msg6 <You're probably right. It wouldn't be entirely unlike her to completely forget her family. Could you go there and make sure she's alright? Even if everything's okay I'd just feel better knowing.>
	Msg7 <I guess you don't care about anyone but yourself, huh? Or maybe you've just got it in for the corps. There's real people who work there, you know, and they might get hurt...>
	Msg8 <Thank you! Here's a passcard to let you into the lab. You can get there through the sandstone caves. Come back here and let me know when you find out about my mother.>
	Msg9 <I understand... This can't seem too urgent to you. I just really hope that nothing has happened to my mother...>
	Msg10 <\ELEMENT 2 in Last Hope asked you to check on her mother \ELEMENT 4 at the BioCorp research station.>
	Msg11 <I'm very worried about my mother... She works at the BioCorp labs. She's been busy lately, but last night she didn't come home and she didn't even call. I'm certain that something must have gone wrong... I hope she's okay.>
	Prompt1 <What are they working on there?>
	Prompt2 <Maybe she was eaten by an experiment...>
	Prompt3 <I'm sure she's just working too hard.>
	Prompt4 <Why should I care about that?>

	Msg2 <Oh man, am I glad to see you... I was trying to sneak into BioCorp labs to get a story on their new mecha project, but the place was attacked! Now I'm trapped here, I can't go back up and I can't get out!>
	Msg3 <Not really... Right after I arrived, before I could find out anything, I heard gunshots. The BioCorp guards were fighting with someone else... then there was a huge explosion, and after that I ran. I managed to hide here but now I'm stuck.>
	Msg4 <The rumor is that they're making an anthropomorphic mecha using pure biological components. They're doing it in Last Hope because it's a small town, so there won't be as many people nosing around. I tried investigating it but now I'm stuck.>
	Msg5 <Yes, that'd help a lot! With this I can get past the guard robots downstairs... Thanks! Be careful, without this card you might be pretty vulnerable yourself... I'll try to send help if I can.>

	Msg2 <The lab was attacked. They were trying to steal our prototype... There was a gun fight with the security force, then a big explosion, and then the unthinkable happened... Cetus woke up.>
	Msg3 <My daughter? I suppose she must have noticed how long I've been gone. Our lab was attacked; it isn't safe here any more. What's more, I can't explain how, but the attackers did something horrible... they woke up Cetus.>
	Msg4 <Cetus is an old bioweapon that we were studying, hoping to copy its technology. It was buried here for years, a mecha-destroyer developed as part of the Hunter-X program... it was never finished, it shouldn't have been able to activate.>
	Msg5 <I don't know. I hid when it started destroying things... I think I'm the only one left alive. We must get back to town quickly, the company has to be informed of what has happened... It'll be quicker to return if we use the helicopter.>
