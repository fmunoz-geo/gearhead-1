	% thing the NPC might want to say. Why? Because a regular combat

	% a campaign, while this one will likely just be encountered once.

	% E1 is the scene for the current episode.
	% E2 is the character who will give the PC a mission.
	% E3 is the scene to be used in the next episode.
	% E4 is the NPC who the PC must battle
