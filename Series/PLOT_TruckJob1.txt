	Msg1 <You've got to help me! A big shipment of merchandise that I had coming from \SCENE EScene 3 was stolen by mecha bandits!>
	Msg2 <Sorry, the shop's closed. A big shipment of merchandise I had coming got nabbed by a mecha gang. Come back tomorrow.>
	Msg3 <The shop's closed.>
	Msg4 <Get out. We're closed.>
	Msg5 <That'd be nice, but they're probably long gone by now. I had something more mundane in mind. I'd like for you to go to \SCENE ESCene 3 and pick up my replacement order.>
	Msg6 <\PERSONA E2 has been tracking the bandits who nabbed my stuff. Maybe you can help catch them.>
	Msg7 <I know, everybody's got their own problems...>
	Msg8 <And I don't care what you think. The shop's closed, get out of here.>
	Msg9 <I'm afraid I don't have anything for sale today. My regular shipment of merchandise was nabbed by a mecha gang.>
	Msg10 <I guess so. Let me have a look.>
	Msg11 <Take it easy, there's some rough characters out there.>
	Msg12 <Well, you're something of a pilot, I know. If you wouldn't mind you could head over to \SCENE EScene 3 and pick up my replacement supplies.>
	Msg13 <The bandits who nabbed my shipment are being investigated by \PERSONA E2 now. Maybe you could help with the case.>
	Msg14 <I've been robbed! My shipment of goods which was supposed to be coming from \SCENE EScene 3 got nabbed by a gang of mecha bandits.>
	Msg15 <I don't have anything in stock. Mecha bandits made off with my latest shipment of goods. If this keeps up, I'll be out of business.>
	Msg16 <My most recent shipment of goods from \SCENE EScene 3 was looted by bandits, but the guardians are investigating the matter. The store will be open again later.>
	Msg17 <That's very kind of you. \PERSONA E2 is taking care of the investigation. Maybe there's some way you could help with that.>
	Msg18 <Thanks for your sympathy.>
	Msg19 <\PERSONA E3 in \SCENE EScene 3 is the merchant I placed the order with. Please go there and pick up the replacement goods. I'll pay you when you return.>
	Msg20 <I suppose you have more interesting things to do. I'll find another driver for this job.>
	Msg21 <Pay is $1500 if you can deliver the goods within three hours. It goes down after that. Are you interested in the job?>
	Msg22 <Great! \PERSONA E3 in \SCENE EScene 3 is your contact for picking up the merchandise. Please hurry back, I really need those supplies!>
	Msg23 <I know, you're not a trucker... I guess I have to find someone else for this job.>

		Msg1 <Were you talking to \PERSONA E1 about the bandits? How'd you like to help me with the case? I could really use your assistance.>

		Msg3 <\PERSONA E1 is the latest victim of the bandits operating in this area. They need to be stopped before anyone else gets hurt. I could really use your help in bringing these criminals to justice.>
		Msg4 <How'd you like to help the community? I've heard that you buy things from \PERSONA E1 sometimes. Bandits robbed an important shipment of goods, and I could use someone to help track them down.>
		Msg5 <Bandits have been robbing \PERSONA E1 and other local merchants. I could use your help in catching them, if you're interested.>
		Msg6 <Good day, citizen. How may I help you?>
		Msg7 <I'm on the job right now. What do you want?>
		Msg8 <I'm busy. Come back later.>
		Msg9 <Excellent. Look at this HandiMap of the area. This is where the bandit base is... right now they're servicing their meks. If we catch them unaware, we can nab them before they refuel. Are you ready to take them on?>
		Msg10 <That's too bad. You know, there is a reward available...>
		Msg11 <That's too bad.>
		Msg12 <A lot of shopkeepers have been losing money to this gang, and they've put together quite a substantial reward. Is $5000 enough for you?>
		Msg13 <Really? I'm investigating the bandits who stole his merchandise right now. I could use some help on the case, if you're interested.>
		Msg14 <Trying to make good, huh? Well, I could use whatever help I can get... Here's the deal. I've found the bandit's hideout. They're refueling their mecha as we speak. If we strike now, we can take them before they get back on board.>
		Msg15 <Normally I'd be suspicious but in this case I need all the help I can get. Here are the coordinates of the bandit camp. If we can approach them while they're refueling, they won't have a chance to get back to their mecha.>
		Msg16 <I'm glad to hear that! There's a reward available for catching the bandits. They're refueling right now. This may be our one chance to catch them out of their mecha.>
		Msg17 <Are you ready yet? We don't have much time before the bandits move again.>
		Msg18 <Get your gear in order, then hurry back. We don't have much time.>
		Msg19 <Here's the info. The bandits have a camp outside of town. Right now they're refueling, so we can catch them outside of their meks.>
		Msg20 <Okay, okay, I get the hint... I'll stop bothering you about it now.>
		Msg21 <Here are the details. The bandit camp is just outside of town. Right now their mecha are being serviced, so if we strike now we can catch them unaware.>
		Msg22 <That's a good point. Well, I'm sure I'll find someone else who's willing to do this mission.>
		Msg23 <Well, That's all I have to offer, so I guess I'll need to find someone else for this job.>

				Msg3 <My shop is closed today. What can I help you with?>
				Msg4 <I don't have a lot of time, but I'll do what I can to help.>
				Msg5 <Take good care of your stuff.>
				Msg6 <Oh... This has to do with the bandit raids, doesn't it? What do you need to know?>
				Msg7 <Electronics, gadgets, some foodstuffs and knick-knacks, a crate of biomem shards for the \SCENE ESCENE 4 Science Academy. A full manifest was submitted to the insurance company.>
				Msg8 <No, as far as I know I'm quite well liked by all the people I deal with.>
				Msg9 <The normal route from here to \SCENE EScene 4 is to follow the Blue Highway.>
				Msg10 <Most of the things that were stolen could probably be unloaded anywhere. There's a big black market for electronics and the like. The biomem shards, on the other hand... Only AI researchers have any use for those.>
				Msg11 <No, none. I often deal in defense hardware, but this shipment was purely civilian.>
				Msg12 <Yes, Artificial Intelligence. Biomem plastic is still pretty experimental stuff. They're saying that Optic-Organic computing could be the way of the future, but the manufacturing price will have to come down before that happens.>
				Msg13 <That's correct. You must really know your science... Regulations prevent it from being bought or sold without a special license. Licenses are generally only given to qualified labs.>
				Msg14 <Go ahead.>
				Prompt1 <Can you repair my equipment?>
				Prompt2 <I'm here to ask you a few questions.>
				Prompt3 <What was in the \SCENE ESCENE 2 shipment?>
				Prompt4 <Do you have any enemies?>
				Prompt5 <What route do your trucks follow?>
				Prompt6 <Who'd want to steal any of that stuff?>
				Prompt7 <No weapons or mecha parts in the shipment?>
				Prompt8 <AI researchers?>
				Prompt9 <BioMem is a controlled substance, right?>
