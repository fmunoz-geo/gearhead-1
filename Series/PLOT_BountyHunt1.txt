	Msg1 <Hey there, hotshot. How would you be interested in doing some bounty hunting? I've got a contract on a wanted criminal, if you're up for it.>
	Msg2 <I just got word of a big contract on an escaped criminal. If you were interested in some bounty hunting work, I could let you be the first one on the case.>
	Msg3 <I'm looking for someone to do some hunting work. There's an escaped criminal with a huge bounty on his head that just moved into town. Are you interested?>
	Msg4 <Can I help you? I'm pretty busy right now.>
	Msg5 <What do you want? I'm busy.>
	Msg6 <Why are you bothering me?>
	Msg7 <That's really too bad. You've got raw skills, and you could make a lot of money in this business.>
	Msg8 <In that case, sorry for wasting your time.>
	Msg9 <In that case, get out of here. I've got to find someone who can complete this contract.>
	Msg10 <We've got a wanted criminal in this area. Your job would be to bring him and his gang in, dead or alive. Upon completion of the mission I'd present you with a load of money. Does that sound good?>
	Msg11 <There's almost always bounties available. I just received a contract on a vicious gang of criminals. You interested in being a hunter?>
	Msg12 <A new contract just arrived today. You look like you might have a bit of talent... Want to hear about the case?>
	Msg13 <No, nothing at the moment.>
	Msg14 <Good day to you.>
	Msg15 <In that case, you should probably go to the library. I'm busy right now.>
	Msg16 <No, you can't use a mecha for this job. We want the criminals aprehended, not half of the countryside reduced to dust...>
	Msg17 <This is where you will find the targets. I don't care whether you have to bring them in dead or alive. Return them to me and I'll give you your reward.>
	Msg18 <Hurry back. Another hunter could very well catch the targets first.>

	Msg114 <Your target is an up-and-coming crime gang. There could be as many as 7 opponents facing you. Pay will be $12000.>

	Msg103 <You'll be facing a group of armed robbers on the run from the law. I would expect maybe 2 or 3 poorly equipped targets. Your salary will be $3000.>
	Msg102 <Your target is a local protection racket. I would expect from 1 to 3 thugs. The reward for this job is $2400.>
	Msg101 <You'll be bringing in a group of robbers. I would expect maybe 1 or 2 poorly equipped targets. Pay will be $2000.>
