	Msg1 <You have freed my tribe from captivity! I don't know how, but I owe you my eternal gratitude... Here is a small reward for your great deeds.>
	Msg2 <With the slaver who took them dead, we have no chance to find what happened to my tribe... all is lost...>
	Msg3 <Have you located my tribe yet? \NARRATIVE 2 is where they were being taken...>
	Msg4 <A great tragedy has befallen our people. The youths of our caravan have been taken away, and I fear that our tribe shall be lost to the sands of oblivion.>
	Msg5 <\NARRATIVE 3 in \NARRATIVE 1 asked you to go to \NARRATIVE 2 and rescue his tribe from those who abducted them.>
	Msg6 <The youths of our caravan have been taken away... Our tribe's blood shall pass into the endless night...>
	Msg7 <It was a devil of the wastes. Our caravan had no enemies; we were attacked without provocation. Those who survived were taken away, along with our food supplies and water. The injured were left to perish in the dust. I alone made it to this town.>
	Msg8 <You know nothing of suffering, but you too shall learn...>
	Msg9 <That is all too likely... At best, they have been sold into slavery. At worst they've been taken by organ ghouls...>
	Msg10 <Truly? I... our entire tribe... would be forever in your gratitude. All I can tell you is the raiders headed for \NARRATIVE 2 following the attack. You may be able to find out what happened to them there.>
	Msg11 <You rescued the tribe of \NARRATIVE 3 from slavers.>
	Prompt1 <Taken away? By who?>
	Prompt1_1 <What are you talking about?>
	Prompt2 <Life is tough, old man.>
	Prompt3 <I can help you find them again!>

	Msg3 <\NARRATIVE 3 ? Yes, I know... good stock, those. Very healthy. They'll make fine laborers. I guess you were sent here to rescue them... Well, I have a deal for you, if you're ready to listen.>
	Msg4 <Don't make me laugh. You won't accomplish anything by hurting me... If there's something you're looking for, we're going to have to deal for it.>
	Msg5 <Don't bother to hurry.>
	Msg6 <I heard how you got past my guards to enter this fortress. You've got skills... I could use someone like you. Agree to work for me, and I'll release those filthy ravagers you're looking for.>
	Msg7 <Come back again when you're in a more receptive mood.>
	Msg8 <Good. I'll release those slaves at once. Keep your handphone nearby, I'll call shortly with details of a mission I need done. Don't fail me or I will make you very very sorry.>
	Msg9 <Don't overestimate your own importance, whelp. If you won't serve me alive then I can just as easily sell your organs when you're dead!!!>
	Msg10 <Erg... You drive a hard bargain, I'll give you that much... Alright, I'll release them. Just stay very far away from me for now on...>
	Msg11 <I like you, so I have another proposition. If you really want them that badly I'll let you buy them for the low price of $300,000. Is it a deal?>
	Msg12 <Those are the only terms I'm willing to accept. You can think about it for a while, of course... just keep in mind that if someone happens to buy the slaves before you return there's nothing I can do about it.>
	Msg13 <Ah, there's nothing like the smell of cash in the morning... I'll have the slaves released immediately.>
	Msg14 <You do that.>
	Prompt1 <I'm looking for the tribe of \NARRATIVE 3 .>
	Prompt2 <I'm here to end your evil ways.>
	Prompt3 <Okay, I'll come back later.>
	Prompt4 <What kind of deal?>
	Prompt5 <I don't make deals with scum like you.>
	Prompt6 <Alright, it's a deal.>
	Prompt7 <How about, you release them or I kill you?>
	Prompt8 <I can't accept that.>
	Prompt9 <It's a deal.>
	CPrompt9 <ifG PC$ 299999 Accept>
	Prompt10 <I'll get back to you on that...>
