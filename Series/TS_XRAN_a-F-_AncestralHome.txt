	Msg1 <Excuse me, are you \PC ? I've been looking for someone of that name... I have an important message.>
	Msg2 <I'm looking for someone named \PC . I've heard that they're visiting town, but I can't find them... You wouldn't know where they are, would you?>
	Msg3 <I've been researching your family. Many years ago during the Age of Superpowers your ancestors were quite influential, and they used to live in this area. I've discovered a ruin that once was their home, but have been unable to examine it.>
	Msg4 <That's too bad. Well, I'll have to keep looking.>
	Msg5 <Really? I thought I asked you that earlier... I must have been mistaken. Anyhow, many years ago your ancestors were very influential in this region. I've discovered an old house of theirs that I'm hoping to study, but haven't been able to yet.>
	Msg6 <There's a ravager tribe living on the land. I've tried to get permission to enter, but they're quite unfriendly to outsiders.>
	Msg7 <\ELEMENT 2 in \ELEMENT 1 has been researching the home of your ancestors.>
	Msg8 <That would be a great help! Are you prepared to head out now, or do you need to get ready?>
	Msg9 <I'm not sure that's a good idea. As I mentioned, they're not very friendly to outsiders. You'd probably be attacked as soon as you got near their camp. Do you really think you have a chance of reasoning with them?>
	Msg10 <I was afraid of that.>
	Msg11 <I'm not in the mecha business so I can't say for certain. From what I've heard you should be able to take them, I'm certain.>
	Msg12 <Alright. Whenever you're ready we can start then.>
	Msg13 <I don't think it is... There must be a safer way to handle the problem...>
	Msg14 <I'm waiting to investigate your family home, but the ravagers still won't let me in. Think you can help me?>
	Msg15 <Come back tomorrow and we can try to engage the ravagers again.>
	Msg16 <You didn't manage to drive them off... Come back tomorrow and we can try again.>
	Msg17 <Here are the coordinates you'll have to examine. Come back here when you're done and let me know how it went.>
	Msg18 <You're very brave, I'll say that much... Here are the coordinates of the ruin. If you can get close to the camp, you'll probably be brought to speak with their leader.>
	Msg19 <You cleared out the ravagers! Now I'll be able to start my explorations... Come back tomorrow or sometime; I may have some interesting finds.>
	Msg20 <You reclaimed your ancestral home.>

	Prompt1 <I'm \PC . What do you want?>
	Prompt2 <I don't know who you're looking for...>
	Prompt3 <Actually, I'm \PC .>
	Prompt4 <Why not?>

	Prompt10 <Give me some time to prepare first.>
	Prompt11 <I'll go speak with them now.>
	Prompt12 <Maybe this isn't a good idea...>
	Prompt13 <All ready to drive out the ravagers...>

	Msg11 <How can we trust you if you don't even give your name!? You have no honor! You will die here!>
	Msg12 <Ah, money opens all doors. You are now free to explore our land... our tribe will be moving on soon anyhow.>
	Msg13 <You don't have that kind of money! Now you will pay for wasting our time and making us disappointed!>
	Msg14 <If you aren't willing to pay, then you aren't welcome here!>
