	Msg102 <There's nothing more sorry than watching someone drink alone. I can't stand it myself, so I always talk to people if they come in here by themselves. How about you?>
	Msg103 <Maybe you will. Have a good time.>
	Msg104 <If you wanted that, you could just as easily stay at home, I would think. Ah well, as long as you're here I shouldn't complain.>

	Msg202 <In my line of work it's a party very nearly every day. Tell me, what will you be drinking to tonight?>
	Msg203 <It's good to see someone in a chipper mood. Grab a mug and let's have a chat.>
	Msg204 <That's a shame. If you need someone to talk to, they say bartenders are better than a psychiatrist.>
	Msg205 <Don't drink!? You shouldn't tell me that, you're going to give me stress.>
