	greeting <NewChat AdvancePlot 0 Say d5>
	Msg1 <I never run away from a battle I've entered. That's why everyone knows I'm the best pilot.>
	Msg2 <Having a good reputation is pretty important. You'll never be hired for the high-paying jobs if people don't think you can handle it.>
	Msg3 <It is my goal to prove myself as the greatest pilot in the world!>
	Msg4 <Everyone loves a winner... Even losers do!>
	Msg5 <If you don't have the best equipment you're never going to survive on an advanced mission.>

	Persona 2
	rumor <!2 is a very bad mecha pilot!>
	greeting <NewChat AdvancePlot 0 Say d5>
	Msg1 <Running away from a hopeless battle might not be honorable, but at least you'll live to fight another day!>
	Msg2 <Reputation isn't all that it's cracked up to be. If your reputation is too good, people will start expecting you to be able to do impossible things.>
	Msg3 <Having all the latest expensive combat gear is nice, but you'll learn quicker if you stick to the basics.>
	Msg4 <He who fights and runs away lives to enjoy retirement.>
	Msg5 <A coward dies a thousand deaths, but a brave man just dies young.>
