	name <TEMPLATE XRAND RELAY>

	% A relay template for Extra-Random plots.

	% The PC will be informed of someone or another who needs help.
	% The PC must then go seek that person, and enter combat there.
	% Other than that the plot works exactly as the temp_xcombat one.

	% Normally, these templates feature plenty of messages which are
	% randomized. This template features just one message for each
	% thing the NPC might want to say. Why? Because a regular combat
	% mission might be encountered dozens of times over the course of
	% a campaign, while this one will likely just be encountered once.

	% E1 is the scene for the current episode.
	% E2 is the character who will tell the PC where to go.
	% E3 is the scene to be used in the next episode.
	% E4 is the character who will give the PC the combat mission.
	Element1 <Grab 3>
	Element2 <Character !Near 1>

	% This NPC's job is just to tell the PC where he can find E4,
	% and probably to explain why the PC should care. The exact nature
	% of everything in this plot is gonna depend upon the XR flags
	% needed to load it, so I'm afraid that I can't help but be vague
	% with my descriptions. Take a look through the TX_XRAN_* plots
	% for examples.

	% Fill in something for the rumor string, so the PC will know who
	% has a job to offer. !2 will add the name of the NPC, while !1

	% I don't know any way to do a generic conversation for this, so
