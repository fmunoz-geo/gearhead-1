	Msg1 <Mecha are power. Without one, you've got nothing.>
	Msg2 <I've got no time for you right now.>
	Msg3 <I've got a good plan going on. By tonight I'm gonna be moving up the ranks.>
	Msg4 <Nothing is for free... If you want anything, you need the power to take it.>
	Msg5 <Later.>
	Msg6 <You don't have what it takes. Get out of here.>

	Msg9 <Of course I do. In fact, I could use your help... There are a couple of rivals that have to be eliminated, and I need a good pilot to do that. You in?>
	Msg10 <Remember, nothing in life is given out for free. If you want something you need the power to take it...>

	Msg11 <Another gang has just recruited an ex-mercenary and all of his equipment. We need to eliminate them before they can move against us. Pay is $180000 for the hit, plus you can keep any leftover meks.>
	Msg12 <We've been double crossed by another gang. I can give you $100000 to take them all out. I want no survivors. Do what you like with the salvage.>
	Msg13 <Two of our rivals have just joined forces. They've got a very impressive mecha force now... It's worth $50000 if you can remove them from the game, and you can keep the salvage.>
	Msg14 <Our guys have been falling behind in the technology curve, but if someone could eliminate the competition's new meks we'd be on top again. How about $30000 for the job? Plus salvage rights, of course.>
	Msg15 <Some outsiders just moved into town. I don't know where they came from, but they've got some awesome machines. I need them eliminated. The job pays $15000 plus salvage. How about it?>
	Msg16 <One of the big gangs in the area has been keeping the rest of us down. I need for them to be taken back a notch or two. Upon elimination of the gang I'll give you $7500, and the salvage is yours. What do you say?>
	Msg17 <A rival gang has just acquired some military grade hardware. I need those meks annihilated as soon as possible. This mission pays $4500 and salvage.>
	Msg18 <One of the rival gangs has been pushing into our territory. I need someone to teach them a permanent lesson. You'll make $3000 plus whatever salvage is left over. What do you think?>
	Msg19 <Some young thugs just bought their first armor units... I need you to make sure it's also their last. I'll give you $1500 for the job, along with salvage rights.>
	Msg20 <A couple of kids got their hands on some light meks and now they think they're a gang. I need you to eliminate them. If you can pull this off it's worth $1000 plus salvage.>
