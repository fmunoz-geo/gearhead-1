	Msg1 <The mission was a failure. We'll have to try again later.>
	Msg2 <Are you ready to start the mission yet?>
	Msg3 <I've got a mission available for any pilot who wants to help maintain the law. Could you help me?>
	Msg4 <I need a good mecha pilot to help fight against the local bandits. It's a shame there are no good pilots in town...>
	Msg5 <I know you haven't exactly been one to work with the guardians, but I have an important mission that needs doing. Think you can help me?>
	Msg6 <You've made a big name for yourself as a good pilot. I have a mission available right now, if you're free to take it.>
	Msg7 <You did it! That camp was completely destroyed. I'm certain that we're getting closer to their main base...>
	Msg8 <That was their main encampment. With their base of operations completely wrecked, the gang will have no choice but to move out of \NARRATIVE 1 . Congratulations on making our city safe once more.>
	Msg9 <You helped the Guardians destroy the Bandit Den of \NARRATIVE 1 .>
	Msg10 <This particular base is home to \VAL V3 points worth of equipment. Be careful, it's all likely to be concentrated near the center of their base.>
	Msg11 <Alright. Just come back when you're done and we can start the operation then.>
	Msg12 <A bandit gang has established a stronghold near town. They've been very elusive, but we've located one of their staging points. If we can destroy their facilities they'll all have to leave. The mission pays $ \VAl V4 .>
	Msg13 <\ELEMENT 2 in \ELEMENT 1 hired you to destroy a bandit encampment.>
	Msg14 <That's disappointing. I'll keep looking for someone else to help.>
	Msg15 <Here are the coordinates. Destroy their power generator and the entire base will fold. Come back here when you're done.>

	Prompt1 <I'm all ready to go!>
	Prompt1_1 <Let's get this mission started.>
	Prompt2 <How many threat points am I facing?>
	Prompt3 <Give me a sec to fuel up.>
	Prompt4 <I'll do it.>
	Prompt4_1 <Okay, I'll help you.>
	Prompt4_2 <Give me the specifics.>
	Prompt5 <Sorry, I can't do that.>
	Prompt5_1 <I'm too busy to help you now.>
	Prompt5_2 <Really, I can't.>
