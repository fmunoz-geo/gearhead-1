	Msg1 <The store is closed. Thanks to those bandits, our latest shipment never arrived. I'm completely out of stock and have no idea when I'll be able to reopen.>
	Msg2 <We're closed. None of my shipments have made it through, ever since those bandits started attacking caravans. The shop will re-open once I have some things to sell.>
	Msg3 <I'm sorry, but we're closed today. You've probably heard that there's been a lot of bandits lately... Well, they made off with my last shipment of goods, and now I'm completely out of stock!>
	Msg4 <The shop is closed. Our delivery truck was robbed by bandits, so I have nothing to sell.>
	Msg5 <My shop is closed, I'm afraid. We can't get new supplies in because of those bandits, and almost everything's out of stock.>

	Msg101 <The shop's still closed. We aren't likely to get any new stock in until tomorrow.>
	Msg102 <Sure, you can do that. I've got some duct tape in the back, that should do.>
	Msg103 <Come back tomorrow and we should have stock in.>
	Msg104 <Nope, nothing.>
	Msg105 <Sure, you can come back tomorrow when I have stock again and buy something. That'd make me feel better, at least.>
	Msg106 <That's a nice thought, but I don't think there's anything that can be done. It's most likely that my goods have already been sold off on the black market...>
	Msg107 <That's a stupid idea. First, most likely my goods have already been sold off on the black market, so that wouldn't do me any good. Second, I was just robbed, so I don't have much cash to be throwing around. Third... you get the point.>
	Msg108 <Hm, it's too late to help me, but you may be able to do something about those bandits... Go speak to one of the guardians. They might have a job for you.>

	Prompt1 <Can I get my stuff repaired?>
	Prompt2 <Is there anything I could do to help?>
	Prompt3 <For a price, I could hunt those bandits down.>
