	% *********************

	% 01 - 05 :  Player has won the battle and is being paid.
	Msg1 <Good job! Here's a reward for your actions. I heard from the head office that these monsters are believed to originate in \NARRATIVE 2 ; maybe you could help out there.>
	Msg2 <From your report, I can tell these were no normal creatures. The guardian office in \NARRATIVE 2 has been fighting similar creatures. Maybe they could use your help as well.>
	Msg3 <You did it. The monsters are gone, and our city is safe. Here's your reward.>
	Msg4 <I was doubtful that there really were monsters, but after seeing those things you fought now I know. I heard a report that more of them were found in \NARRATIVE 2 .>
	Msg5 <Congratulations on a successful monster hunt. Here's the bounty you earned.>

	% 06 - 10 :  Player has lost the battle.
	Msg6 <They got away, but at least now we know that  they exist.>
	Msg7 <So, the critters put up more resistance than we thought. Guess I'll have to organize another search party.>
	Msg8 <You saw them? Good. We'll head back and destroy them this time.>
	Msg9 <From the description you provided, these were most certainly not wild animals. You're lucky to be alive.>
	Msg10 <You didn't stop the monsters, but the information you provided should help us to deal with them.>

	% 11 - 15 :  Description of mission.
	%  use "$ \VAL V4 " to insert the pay for the mission,
	%  and don't forget to mention that the PC also gets salvage.
	Msg11 <They were last spotted in a wildzone south of here. I can pay $ \VAL V4 if you can get rid of the critters.>
	Msg12 <The monsters allegedly damaged a campground on the city limits. That'd be a good place to start looking. The job is worth $ \VAL V4 .>
	Msg13 <They were last spotted to the north of town. You'll get $ \VAL V4 as soon as you exterminate the monsters.>
	Msg14 <The most recent reports placed the monsters east of here. If you can find them, exterminate them. Pay for this job is $ \VAL V4 .>
	Msg15 <They should be in the western wildzone. The bounty for these monsters is $ \VAL V4 .>

	% 16 - 20 :  Player is asked if he is looking for a job.
	Msg16 <Are you busy? There have been reports of a monster near town, and I could use someone to investigate.>
	Msg17 <If you're looking for a job, I have a patrol mission available. There's been a monster reported near town and I need someone to investigate.>
	Msg18 <How'd you like to run a guardian mission? Monsters have been reported outside of town, but until these monsters actually do anything I can't spare the manpower to investigate.>
	Msg19 <Hear about the monsters everyone's been seeing? Well, we have one in \SCENE ESCene 2 now. I've got a mission available to go investigate, if you're interested.>
	Msg20 <Need a job? \SCENE EScene 2 has monster trouble, and I could use someone to go investigate.>

	% 21 - 25 :  NPC implies job, PC might have chance to get it.
	Msg21 <There have been a number of strange monsters spotted outside of town recently. All the guardians have been searching for them, but I fear it may not be enough.>
	Msg22 <We've been searching for a monster that has been spotted outside of town. It may be connected to that hiker who disappeared last week.>
	Msg23 <Some kind of wild animal has been digging up gardens and killing dogs on the outskirts of town. I think it's just a rabid nazzhog, but I better investigate in case it's one of those monsters we've been hearing about.>
	Msg24 <There have been some problems lately. There's been a lot of reports about strange creatures, so all the guardians are busy. We haven't turned up much yet, though.>
	Msg25 <Did you hear about the monsters? Well, we may have one in town. I've been getting complaints about a mysterious creature lurking in the wilds. We have to catch it, before it manages to hurt someone!>

	% 26 - 30 :  PC will be told exact enemy point value.
	%  use "\VAL V3 " to insert the value.
	Msg26 <Nobody seems quite certain. The best theory so far seems to be that they're bioweapons.>
	Msg27 <That's a good question. Could be just a wild animal, as far as I can tell. People are really jumpy lately.>
	Msg28 <I've heard everything, that they might be ghosts or bioweapons or aliens or anything. My money says it's not anything so exciting.>
	Msg29 <Could be a giant rat that's moved into the area, could be a Hunter-Slayer bioweapon escaped from a containment site. The only way we're gonna find out is for you to go see.>
	Msg30 <I can't even be sure that there is a monster out there. If not for the fact that we've been hearing about monsters from all over, I'd be tempted to chalk the reports up to paranoia.>

	% 31 - 35 :  "PLAN A" or "PLAN B" worked... the PC is offered
	%  a job and may choose either prompt7/8 to accept or prompt9/10
	%  to reject it.
	Msg31 <I could use some help on this case, that's certainly true. How'd you like to investigate one of the sightings, and eliminate any monsters you come across?>
	Msg32 <A team-up might be in order. There's too much ground for me to cover alone, but if you could patrol an area and kill any monsters you find there, that'd be great.>
	Msg33 <Would you be willing to run a few patrols for me? If you encounter any monsters you can take them out; there'll be a reward involved if you're interested.>
	Msg34 <If you'd like a job, I can offer a patrol mission. Take a look around the wilds on foot; if you find any monsters, destroy them and come collect the reward.>
	Msg35 <There's a patrol mission available. We don't have enough manpower to cover the entire area outside of town, so I can hire you to search an area and destroy any monsters you encounter.>

	% 36 - 40 :  Combat is starting.
	Msg36 <Make sure you come back in one piece. If those critters kill anyone I have to fill out another report.>
	Msg37 <Good luck out there.>
	Msg38 <Report back here after you're found the creatures, and I'll give you your reward then.>
	Msg39 <Thanks for your help.>
	Msg40 <Come back safe.>


	% 101 :  Player accepted job, then left to get ready.
	Msg101 <Ready to go exterminate yet?>
	% 102 :  Player has refused to take job; answer to prompts 9-10.
	Msg102 <Ah, well. It's likely to be dangerous work... and believe me, it's thankless.>
	% 103 :  Player has asked for some time to get ready.
	Msg103 <Come back when you're ready and we can start.>
	% 104 :  "PLAN A" has failed, and the PC is not offered a job.
	Msg104 <We aren't looking for outside help on this one. It's a guardian matter.>
	% 105 :  "PLAN B" has failed, and the PC is not offered a job.
	Msg105 <If you looked half as tough as you think you are, I'd hire you in a minute.>
	% 106 :  Player doesn't want job; answer to prompts 17-19.
	msg106 <Be careful out there.>
	% 107 :  Memo
	msg107 <\ELEMENT 2 in \SCENE EScene 2 asked you to exterminate some monsters.>

	% 01 - 02 :  Ready to start the mission
	Prompt1 <I'm ready to go.>
	Prompt2 <Be back when I'm finished.>

	% 03 - 04 :  Need time to get ready first.
	Prompt3 <Give me some time to get ready.>
	Prompt4 <I better prepare, first.>

	% 05 - 06 :  What is the enemy point value?
	Prompt5 <What am I up against out there?>
	Prompt6 <What kind of monsters are these?>

	% 07 - 08 :  After being asked if he wants a job, PC says yes.
	Prompt7 <Absolutely.>
	Prompt8 <I'd love to.>

	% 09 - 10 :  After being asked if he wants a job, PC says no.
	Prompt9 <Definitely not.>
	Prompt10 <That's not my kind of work.>

	% 11 - 13 : Player tries to get job using PLAN "A".
	Prompt11 <I'd like to help your case.>
	Prompt12 <I've worked with the Guardians before.>
	Prompt13 <Are you asking for my help?>

	% 14 - 16 : Player tries to get job using PLAN "B".
	Prompt14 <You need an expert hunter, like me.>
	Prompt15 <I could take those monsters easy.>
	Prompt16 <Maybe I'm crazy enough to go fight them.>

	% 17 - 19 : Player doesn't much care for the job.
	Prompt17 <That's grunt work; I'm a pilot.>
	Prompt18 <Sorry, I can't help you.>
	Prompt19 <Not interested.>
