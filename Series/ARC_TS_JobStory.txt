	Msg2 <Welcome to Hogye Hospital. Ask Doctor Kim about the job you've been offered. He'll explain what your duties will be.>
	Msg3 <You want a job here? I don't know anything about that... talk to Doctor Kim.>
	Msg4 <We do all kinds of diagnostic work here at the hospital. I'm supposed to do some blood analysis, but our centrifuge is busted. Maybe you could have a look at it. I think it's a simple electrical problem.>
	Msg5 <Wow! That was fantastic! I think the centrifuge works better now than it did when we bought it... Good job! You've earned $200 for your efforts, but I guess this was so easy for you that you probably didn't learn much.>
	Msg6 <Very good. The centrifuge is working again, I can get back to analyzing blood samples. Go report to Doctor Kim.>
	Msg7 <You've repaired the centrifuge. It's working well enough for me to do this blood analysis, but I think I should bring it to Quentin later so he can take a look at it. Go report to Doctor Kim.>
	Msg8 <Argh! Please, stop doing that to my poor delicate machine! Maybe you should study some general repair before trying something like this again. I certainly hope that taking my centrifuge apart was educational... Go report to Doctor Kim.>
	Msg9 <I'm busy doing blood analysis. Doctor Kim might have another task for you.>
	Msg10 <I know that working in this hospital isn't very exciting. Maybe if we were a big city emergency center... But, I have a job for you that should be more interesting. Supplies need to be delivered to Snake Lake. Come back in a few minutes.>
	Msg11 <Oh, it's you again. How would you like to leave here and go someplace more exciting? We've got a package of medical supplies that needs to be delivered to Snake Lake. It'll be finished in a few minutes, you can take it then.>
	Msg12 <The package is ready. Doctor Kim will set you up with some transportation.>

	Msg1 <So, Megi tells me that you're looking for a job. Very good... We could use all kinds of help here at the hospital. To start with, what would you say your major skills are?>
	Msg2 <You haven't started on your job yet... The position is still open if you're still interested. You can earn some money and gain some experience. First I need to know, what are your skills?>
	Msg3 <Oh, sorry, I didn't notice that you were bleeding all over the place. Where does it hurt?>
	Msg4 <Take care out there. It's a dangerous world.>
	Msg5 <Well, you'll probably get a chance to use your talents here. Go talk to Nurse Park about the centrifuge. The stupid thing is broken again.>
	Msg6 <You probably won't get a chance to do much of that here, but well, you never can tell. Life is sort of unpredictable. I believe that Nurse Park could use your help right about now; see what you can do.>
	Msg7 <Go speak to Nurse Park.>
	Msg8 <Hello. I have another task for you. It's quite simple, really. Here are some mycotoxosis test slides. I need you to check each of them, and indicate any slides which have a blue spot.>

	Msg9 <Excellent work. You have really good eyesight. We used to have a robot for sorting these tests, but you know they just don't build help like they used to.>
	Msg10 <Thank you very much. Your eyesight is quite good... I ruined mine by playing too many computer games in university.>
	Msg11 <That's done. Now I can tell Hyolee that all of her mutant rabbits are perfectly healthy. Thanks for helping.>
	Msg12 <Are you by any chance color blind? Here, I'll finish this up myself. You might want to think about practicing your Awareness skill some time, you know.>

	Msg13 <I don't need any more help right now, but I might later. Go talk to Nurse Park.>

	Msg14 <There's a crate of medical supplies which has to be delivered to Snake Lake Hospital. Here's a car for you to travel in... I know it's a generous gift, but us doctors are loaded. Come back after you've dropped off the goods.>

		Msg2 <Great! I've been waiting for this shipment to arrive! This will help us to deal with the recent outbreak of beaver fever.>
