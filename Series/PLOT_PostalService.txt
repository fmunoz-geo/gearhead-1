	Msg1 <Email is so convenient. I can keep up with my friends in \SCENE EScene 2 without needing to wait for postal delivery.>
	Msg2 <Do you use email? I just love writing letters to my friends all over the world.>
	Msg3 <Yes I do! My favorite is the little winking smilie face... You know! One of my chat buddies emailed me a big list of hypercons once. It was so cute. I could foreword it to you, if you'd like.>
	Msg4 <I guess you get to do a lot of traveling, but most of us aren't so lucky. Say, do you know where \SCENE EScene 2 is?>
	Msg5 <Ah. Well, for those of us who like to use it, it's a wonderful tool. Most of the time, that is...>
	Msg6 <That's so great! I check and reply to my email every day. I wish everyone were so thoughtful...>
	Msg7 <Sort of. Tell me, do you know where \SCENE EScene 2 is?>
	Msg8 <My friend \PERSONA E2 who lives in \SCENE EScene 2 is always late replying to email. I could really use for someone to go remind \PERSONA E2 to check my letter.>
	Msg9 <That's too bad... My friend \PERSONA E2 lives there. I hear that it's very nice.>
	Msg10 <Kind of. My friend \PERSONA E2 who lives in \SCENE EScene 2 is really bad at replying to email. I need someone to go remind \PERSONA E2 to check their mail.>
	Msg11 <Then don't blame me when kids start calling you "Gramps".>
	Msg12 <I don't know... I just thought that maybe, if you were in \SCENE EScene 2 some time, you could just do this on your way through. Can you do this for me?>
	Msg13 <Thank you very much! Remember, tell \PERSONA E2 in \SCENE EScene 2 to check email. I appreciate this very much!>
	Msg14 <I honestly don't think so... \PERSONA E2 is just really really bad at replying to email. Will you deliver the message for me?>
	Msg15 <Oh, that's too bad.>

	Prompt1 <Me too! Do you like emoticons?>
	Prompt2 <I prefer meeting friends in person.>
	Prompt3 <No, I don't.>
	Prompt4 <I'd like that!>
	Prompt5 <Does this conversation have a point?>
	Prompt6 <Yes... Why?>
	Prompt7 <No I don't.>
	Prompt8 <Do you have a problem with your email?>
	Prompt9 <I don't really care about it.>
	Prompt10 <What's it worth to you?>
	Prompt11 <I can do that.>
	Prompt12 <Maybe \PERSONA E2 doesn't want to talk to you.>
	Prompt13 <I don't want to.>
