	Msg2 <Don't go yet! Just chat with me for a bit more. It'll be worth your time, believe me.>

	Msg101 <The Federated Territories is a pretty safe place to live. Well, safe compared to the dead zone anyways... You'll still need to defend yourself from time to time. Having the right equipment will help.>
	Msg102 <You'll need at least one weapon. Don't worry too much about what kind just yet... Just pick something you can afford. Armor is also important. Try to get coverage for all six body areas- your head, your torso, both arms and both legs.>
	Msg103 <Items have to be equipped before they can be used. Just between you and me, that can be done using the "i" key. Oh, here's another piece of advice- press "h" for the help menu.>
	Msg104 <Great. Right now you should pick some basic adventuring gear- a weapon and some armor. If you can't find what you're looking for I'll see if I have anything else in stock.>
	Msg105 <There. Remember to equip those items after you're finished here. Did you get everything you need?>
	Msg106 <Good. Next, I've got a job for you. This will help teach you the basics of combat and let you earn a few dollars at the same time.>
	Msg107 <That's a common complaint of adventurers. If you'd like to earn some money, I have a job available. This will also teach you the basics of combat.>
	Msg108 <Take another look through the store. Maybe I can find something that you'll like.>

	Msg102 <Thank you! You're very heroic. The rat is just down these stairs... Are you ready to go now, or do you need some time to prepare?>
	Msg103 <I can give you $1000 for the job. I certainly hope that's enough... Are you ready to go now, or do you need some time to prepare?>
	Msg104 <Kill it, of course. Those things are deadly vicious. If you have a gun you can shoot it by pressing 'a'... Otherwise you're going to have to get close to the rat and engage it in melee.>

	Msg202 <How'd you get out of there without killing the rat!? Something's strange... anyhow, you didn't do what I asked, so I can't give you a reward. But, here's a mecha, since you're gonna need it. Quentin will show you how to use it.>

		Msg101 <The first thing you'll need to know is how to read your mecha's statistics. Just as every character is described by stats, so is every mecha.>
		Msg102 <Most folks assume that mass is very important. A big mecha looks far more dangerous than a light one, but often it isn't. The Claymore is big, but its technology is old. The Kojedo is much smaller but also much deadlier.>
		Msg103 <MV is Maneuverability. TR is Targeting Rating. SE is Sensor class. While performing actions with your mecha, these ratings get added to your skill rank. The higher the better. Your Corsair has MV:-2, TR:-2, and SE:+1.>
		Msg104 <PV is the cost of your mecha in tactical threat points. It's a better measure of combat worth than mass, MV, or TR alone. Conveniently, PV is also the market price of your mecha in credits.>
