	Msg1 <Welcome to my garage. I've been getting a lot of good salvage recently, so I've got a lot of bits for sale.>
	Msg2 <Take a look around, and if you see anything that might be useful you can make me an offer.>
	Msg3 <If anything gets broken, bring it back here for service.>
	Msg4 <Hey, you're an adventurer, aren't you? I've got some work that someone like you could help me with. See, there's a number of junked mecha just outside of town, and I'd like to get my hands on them for spare parts...>
	Msg5 <Oh, alright then. Here's what we have available today.>
	Msg6 <The wreckage is swarming with monsters. Seems the pilot who crashed was transporting recalled snack cakes when his machine went down... If you could get rid of the monsters, I could reward you with a bit of the salvage.>
	Msg7 <\ELEMENT 1 in \SCENE EScene 1 wants you to get rid of some monsters infesting a broken mecha.>
	Msg8 <I've been waiting for you to get back. Ready to go clear out that crash zone yet?>
	Msg9 <Okay. You do whatever it is that you have to do, then come back here and we'll get started.>
	Msg10 <I understand. Fighting monsters just so you can get to the shiny junk they've collected isn't everyone's cup of tea...>
	Msg11 <Well, you didn't quite manage to drive off the creatures. By the time I can get there now the salvage will probably be worthless...>
	Msg12 <You did it! Since I'm in a generous mood, I'll give you one of the recovered mecha that was in nearly-pilotable condition. Thanks for your help.>
	Msg13 <Drive off or kill all the monsters, then come back here and we can discuss what kind of a reward you've got coming.>

	Prompt1 <Let me see what you have.>
	Prompt2 <I'm just here to get repairs.>
	Prompt3 <What do you want me to do?>
	Prompt4 <Sounds good. I'm ready to go.>
	Prompt5 <I need some time to get ready first.>
	Prompt6 <On second thought, I don't want this job.>
