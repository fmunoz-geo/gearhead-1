		Msg1 <Hi \PC . I heard that you were planning to leave here soon.>
		Msg2 <Yeah, there isn't much here, unless you want to grow potatoes for the rest of your life... Oh, I heard that Megi wanted to see you before you leave. She probably has some advice or something. You know her...>
		Msg3 <I understand. If I were you I'd want to get as far away from this place as I could... Before you go, though, Megi wanted to speak with you. She's been very concerned about you since the accident.>
		Msg4 <Sounds like fun, but I really can't. This is the best place for my research... no distractions. By the way, Megi said that she wants to see you before you leave. Maybe she wants to go with you herself? That's a scary thought...>
		Msg5 <Good luck. We'll miss you here.>
		Msg6 <In the same place you usually can, in her house, that white one over there with the red carpet... Hm, I hope that when you go exploring the world, you don't get lost. Your direction sense never was that good...>
		Prompt1 <I want to see the world.>

		Msg102 <It's the white house with the red carpet. There's only one like it in town. Come to think of it, there aren't that many houses in Hogye, anyhow... You should be able to find it by trial and error if you had to.>
		Msg103 <Good luck, with whatever the future holds...>
		Prompt101 <Where is Megi's house, again?>

		Msg103 <There isn't much here in Hogye to keep young people in the community. It's a shame, but there isn't much that can be done about it so long as there's no work in the area. What do you expect to do?>
		Msg104 <That would be a good job to take, if you can pass their strict entrance requirements. Before you go, is there anything that I can help you with?>
		Msg105 <That's a dangerous and in my opinion foolish job to take... but, if that is your desire, nothing I say will stop you. Before leaving town, is there any last thing I can do to help prepare you for your journey?>
